# Hyperlinks of AI

The aim of hyperlinks of ai is to build a dataset of links related to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).

Our current effort is towards finding links to AI institutes, centres and groups around the world to build a curated hyperlink network.

This effort was started as a research project by Alex Moltzau (Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium), Carl Mörch (FARI, MILA), Vincent Mai (MILA), and Ricardo Chavarriaga (ZHAW) to better understand how different public websites in the field of AI display information about sustainability and AI ethics. The work to gather links was done with initial assistance from Julien Bastogne and Jørgen Amundsen.

An initial presentation of preliminary results was made at the Sustainable AI conference, hosted by Aimee van Wynsberghe at the University of Bonn on the 16th of June 2021:

After the conference a discussion was held with Federica Lucivero (University of Oxford, Ethox) and Gabrielle Samuel (King's College London) who had been working together on AI and environmental sustainability. Nataliya Tkachenko (University of Oxford) also joined this meeting, and it was agreed to proceed to build a shared dataset of hyperlinks within the field of AI together.

### ai_academic_entity.csv

This file was first posted on the 1st of July 2021 with a list of 469 hyperlinks and associated AI academic entities. These are a mix of AI-related institutes, labs, and groups. This .csv is currently a rough draft with three columns: (1) ai_academic_entity, (2) country, and (3) link. The current dataset is a draft and has not been cleaned for possible duplicates.

### General thoughts

*This section is updated regularly and may differ from day to day*

- There are limitations when infering based on a hyperlink network of associations, and these need to be explored.
- The different actors may be different even within one intended unit of analysis. For example AI institutes, labs, and groups differ both within the context of one country as well as across regions.
- One aspect that could be interesting is the changes in the network over time. Another possibility is to see how the use of different words change over time, such as the use of 'sustainability', 'ethics', 'environmental', etc.
- Mapping AI-related academic entities in different regions may be challenging due to differences in language, or be biased towards websites where English is used primarily.
- It has been pointed out that a large portion of the research community in the field of AI works within large private technology companies. As such it might be possible to build a complementary dataset of private AI research entities at Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.

### Visual network analysis
Munk (2019) in his exploration of the Nordic food movement on the web used a hyperlink network as part of a qualitative exploration. These thoughts can be seen in considerations of Visual Network Analysis as a qualitative method (Decuypere, 2020).

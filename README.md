# Hyperlinks of AI

The aim of hyperlinks of ai is to build a dataset of links related to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).

Our current effort is towards finding links to AI institutes, centres and groups around the world to build a curated hyperlink network.

This effort was started as a research project by Alex Moltzau (Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium), Carl Mörch (FARI, MILA), Vincent Mai (MILA), and Ricardo Chavarriaga (ZHAW) to better understand how different public websites in the field of AI display information about sustainability and AI ethics. The work to gather links was done with initial assistance from Julien Bastogne and Jørgen Amundsen.

An initial presentation of preliminary results was made at the Sustainable AI conference the 16th of June 2021:

### General thoughts

*This section is updated regularly and may differ from day to day*

- There are limitations when infering based on the network might show associations, but one can only judge the public communication of the page, not too much beyond this scope.
- The different actors may be different even within one intended unit of analysis. For example AI institutes, labs, and groups differ both within the context of one country as well as across regions.

### Visual network analysis
Munk (2019) in his exploration of the Nordic food movement on the web used a hyperlink network as part of a qualitative exploration. These thoughts can be seen in considerations of Visual Network Analysis as a qualitative method (Decuypere, 2020).

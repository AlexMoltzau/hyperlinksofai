# Hyperlinks of AI

The aim of hyperlinks of ai is to build a dataset of links related to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).

Our current effort is towards finding links to AI institutes, centres and groups around the world to build a curated hyperlink network.

This effort was started as a research project by Alex Moltzau (Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium), Carl Mörch (FARI, MILA), Vincent Mai (MILA), and Ricardo Chavarriaga (ZHAW) to better understand how different public websites in the field of AI display information about sustainability and AI ethics. The work to gather links was done with initial assistance from Julien Bastogne and Jørgen Amundsen.

An initial presentation of preliminary results was made at the Sustainable AI conference the 16th of June 2021:
